# About the project

I am a DevOps engineer always trying to refine my skills in creating and maintaning CICD pipelines for webapps.
I got this freely available calculator app code here on github. I created a GitHub Actions workflow to compile, dockerize and push to ECR, then later deploy to a K8s cluster.

The original developer of this app is Dhanush N
